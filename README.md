## Building

To install the tool dependencies, run
```shell
$ npm install
```
in the main directory.
Alternatively, you can use your global installations of these tools.

For a development build, run
```shell
$ npm run build
```
then open `dev/index.html`.

For a production build, run
```shell
$ npm run build-prod
```
then open `prod/index.html`.

For live-reloading on changes to the code, run
```shell
$ npm run serve
```
This will automatically open the app in a browser,
and recompile and reload the page every time a source file is changed.
